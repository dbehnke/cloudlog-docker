# This must be what you will type in to your browser to access Cloudlog
# eg if you have LOCAL=true and your docker host has an IP of 192.168.1.10 on your LAN 
# then put https://192.168.10.1
# If hosting on a domain then put that here, eg https://log.m0spf.uk
# If you dont want https then you must delete the certificates in ./data/certs and change to http below (not recommended)

# This is used by the proxy and letsencrypt, this has to be a name even if you intend to use an IP address
